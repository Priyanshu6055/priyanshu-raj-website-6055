ðŸ’» Personal Portfolio Website
This is my personal website designed to showcase my projects, skills, and experience as a Full Stack Web Developer. It serves as a digital resume and a central hub for anyone interested in learning more about my work and technical background.

The frontend of the website is built using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, offering a clean, modern, and fully responsive user interface across all devices. The smooth UI/UX and minimal design ensure an engaging browsing experience.

On the backend, the site is powered by Node.js and Express.js, handling form submissions, API endpoints, and server-side functionality securely and efficiently. This project reflects my proficiency in both frontend and backend technologies, as well as my ability to build and maintain full-stack web applications.
